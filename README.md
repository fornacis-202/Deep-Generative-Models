# Deep-Generative-Models
This repository contains implementations of several generative models.

## VAE-face
An implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch. The model is trained on images of human faces and can generate new images by sampling from the normal distribution and decoding them through the decoder. Additionally, the model has been applied to transform non-smiling faces into smiling ones.

## Normalizing Flow-RealNVP

A Normalizing Flow model based on RealNVP architecture, trained on Fashion MNIST dataset. Additionally, the model has been evaluated for its capability to perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.
